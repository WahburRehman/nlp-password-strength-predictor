# 🔐 Password Strength Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview  
This project aims to predict the strength of passwords using Machine Learning techniques. The model classifies passwords as weak, medium, or strong based on their security level, helping users create stronger passwords.

## 🛠️ Steps Involved  

1. **Data Cleaning** – Preprocess and clean the dataset to remove inconsistencies.  
2. **Performing Semantic Analysis** – Analyze the meaning and structure of passwords.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Extract relevant features from passwords.  
4. **Applying TF-IDF** – Convert passwords into numerical vectors using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).  
5. **Training the Machine Learning Model** – Apply Logistic Regression to classify password strength.  
6. **Making Predictions** – Test the trained model on sample password data.  
7. **Evaluating Model Performance** – Assess the model using the confusion matrix, accuracy score, and classification report.  

## 🏗️ Tech Stack  
- **Python**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Matplotlib**  
- **Seaborn**  
- **Scikit-learn**  

## 📊 Model Evaluation  
The model performance is evaluated using:  

- **Confusion Matrix** – Visualizing correct and incorrect classifications  
- **Accuracy Score** – Measuring overall prediction accuracy  
- **Classification Report** – Providing precision, recall, and F1-score
